### Poetry

My poems have been published or are forthcoming in [*Frogpond*](http://www.hsa-haiku.org/frogpond/index.html) ([41:2](/poems/blackberry.md), 42:1), *Indiana Review*, *Modern Haiku* (50:1), and *Women's Studies: An inter-disciplinary journal* ([47:6](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/TZPzIzbIQ9FtvsHs9rX8/full), [47:7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00497878.2018.1545961)). 

I am fortunate to be a recipient of the Bain-Swigget Poetry Prize from Princeton University, and the Dorothy Rosenberg Memorial Prize in Lyric Poetry from University of California, Berkeley.
