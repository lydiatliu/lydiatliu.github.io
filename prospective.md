Thank you for your interest in my research group! I am looking for motivated students and postdoc collaborators for the coming academic year.

If youâ€™re interested in working together, please look at my [selected publications](/) or my [research page](/projects) to see my recent work.
I enourage you to skim the abstracts and read a paper or two to ascertain if we have common interests. If so, please follow the relevant instructions below.

*Undergraduate students:*
If you're already at Princeton, please review my [independent work research topics](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/independent-work/undergraduate-research-topics#Liu) and email me with your academic transcript, resume, and a brief (3-5 sentences) statement of purpose.
**Due to a high volume of emails, I am unable to respond to individual email inquiries from college and pre-college students not currently at Princeton.**

*Prospective Postdocs and Fellows:* 
Please apply to the Center for Information Technology Policy [fellows program](https://citp.princeton.edu/about/hiring/) or other postdoctoral programs on campus, and signal an interest in collaborating on research with me.

Please apply to the PhD program in the Princeton Department of Computer Science and indicate an interest in working with me in your statement. **Due to a high volume of emails, I am unable to respond to individual email inquiries regarding PhD admissions.**
