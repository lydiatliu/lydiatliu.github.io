Thank you for your interest in my research group! I am looking for motivated students and postdoc collaborators for the current and coming academic year.

If youâ€™re interested in working together, please look at my [selected publications](/) or my [research page](/projects) to see my recent work, and my recent [courses](/teaching) to see what topics I'm currently thinking about.
I encourage you to skim the abstracts and read a paper or two to ascertain if we have common interests. If you believe so, please follow the relevant instructions below.

*Undergraduate and Masters Students:*
If you're already at Princeton, please review my [independent work research topics](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/independent-work/undergraduate-research-topics#Liu) and email me with your academic transcript, resume, and a brief (3-5 sentences) statement of purpose. For senior thesis or independent work advising, please email me at least *two* months prior to the IW/Thesis semester.
**Due to a high volume of emails, I am unable to respond to individual email inquiries from college and pre-college students not currently at Princeton.**

*Prospective Postdocs and Fellows:* 
Please apply to the Center for Information Technology Policy [fellows program](https://citp.princeton.edu/about/hiring/) or other postdoctoral programs on campus, and signal an interest in collaborating on research with me.

*Prospective PhD Students:* 
Please apply to the PhD program in the Princeton [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad) and indicate an interest in working with me in your statement. **Due to a high volume of emails, I am unable to respond to individual email inquiries regarding PhD admissions.**

**Princeton's [Master's Program in Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/masters-degree) actively encourages applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.** If you are interested in a fully-funded two year Masters program with exposure to teaching, research and coursework, please apply and indicate an interest in working with me in your statement.
