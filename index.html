	<h1>Lydia T Liu</h1>
		<p>I'm a final year undergraduate studying statistics and machine learning at Princeton University. 
			My research interests are high dimensional statistics and stochastic optimization. I'm also
			interested in applying that to deep neural networks for representation learning 
			and generative modelling. At Princeton, I'm fortunate to work with Amit Singer and Han Liu.
			I've also spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Katja Hofmann 
			and Urun Dogan. Read about my <a href="/projects">research</a>.</p>
