	<h1>Lydia T. Liu</h1>
		<p>I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Michael Jordan and Moritz Hardt.
			Previously I obtained my BSE in Operations Research and Financial Engineering from Princeton University, 
			where I was fortunate to work with Amit Singer and Han Liu. I have also spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Katja Hofmann and Urun Dogan.
			My interests are in <b>high dimensional statistics</b> and <b>stochastic optimization</b>. For applications,
			I am interested in problems in the empirical sciences, and in artificial intelligence. Read about my
