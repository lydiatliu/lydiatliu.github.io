	<h1>Lydia T. Liu</h1>
		<p>I am a final year undergraduate studying and researching statistics and machine learning at Princeton University. 
			My interests are in <b>high dimensional statistics</b> and <b>stochastic optimization</b>. For applications,
			I am interested in the empirical sciences, and in artificial intelligence, 
			including deep neural networks for unsupervised and reinforcement learning. At Princeton, 
			I am fortunate to work with Amit Singer and Han Liu. I have also spent a wonderful summer 
			at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Katja Hofmann and Urun Dogan. Check out my 
			<a href="/projects">research</a>.</p>
