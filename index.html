	<h1>Lydia T Liu</h1>
		<p>I am a final year undergraduate, and aspiring researcher, studying statistics and machine learning at Princeton University. 
			My research interests are high dimensional statistics and stochastic optimization. I am also
			interested in applying that to deep neural networks for representation learning 
			and generative modelling. At Princeton, I am fortunate to work with Amit Singer and Han Liu.
			I have also spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Katja Hofmann 
			and Urun Dogan. Read about my <a href="/projects">research</a>.</p>
	<p> I am sometimes a <a href="/writing">poet</a>.</p>
