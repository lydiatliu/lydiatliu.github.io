### lorem ipsum

<p align="justify">
(primal sound) mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmm mm mmmmmm <br>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet when I wake up every next morning I <br>
am still lost in rehearsal am still searching for sleep does not manu-<br>
facture purpose but what I hear always is song lorem ipsum (rest)<br>
I sin sometimes under the florescent light bulbs in front of mirrors <br>
they all go off at once sometimes (rest) yes I have sinned and no I <br>
no I do not repent sometimes sorry I do not repent but I still want <br>
to be forgiven sometimes so I cry out to no one lorem ipsum dolor <br>
(rest) what about joy I have joyed in shame I have joyed in anguish <br>
when I have exhausted every last grrrah what is left you know I am <br>
dying to be good I planned to be original like the zeroth drop of ink <br>
on paper but your plan is not mine (rest) all the minutes I spent being <br>
unsure simply break into song you know it you know it lorem ipsum <br>
dolor sit amet if I sing to no one loud enough purpose will find me be-<br>
cause the music never dies the music never dies the music never <br>
(primal sound) mmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmm
