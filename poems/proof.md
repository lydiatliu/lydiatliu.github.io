### proof


Take epsilon of me and  
epsilon of you  

&nbsp;

in March there is an  
epsilon of snow  
that descends  
like teeth  
sinking into tori  
but  
it is warm  
in the interior  

&nbsp;  

an afternoon I spend  
tracing your convexity  
but complexity  
lingers between us  
and  
the density  
of rationality  

&nbsp;  

gave  

&nbsp;  

given an epsilon  
of me  

&nbsp;  

the quiet of your breath exists  
there exists  

&nbsp;
