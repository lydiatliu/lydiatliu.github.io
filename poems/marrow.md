### Marrow

Huddled around one end of the bar top we  
side-eyed our neighbors, swallowing our salivas when  
the server swooped in with the  
Roasted bone marrow  

&nbsp;  

A monstrous thing, like dinosaur bone  
but barely enough for three hungry goons  
We feed, we dig our spoons into the springy fat of dead pig  
Spread savagely onto toast  

&nbsp;  

At my parentâ€™s dinner table there was always marrow  
from the pig bones in the pig bone soup a weekly offering  
to the hunger gods  
will be pleased  

&nbsp;  

all the globs of pig bone on my plate  
the springiness the braininess the fat?  
suck it all suck it all  

&nbsp;  

some mornings when I wake up  
feeling tiredness  
in my bones I remember  
in my bones there is marrow  

&nbsp;  

and it will make you strong so strong I  
dug deep with my baby chopstick and sucked for dear  
marrow
