### A pair of tanka

after the snow  
sound is stolen from the world  
white and still  
are my thoughts  
sitting beside me quietly  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




<span style ="display:inline-block;margin-left:15em;">
after the snow  
sound falls from a tree top branch  
a pale green bud  
saying it is time  
to dance again  
</span>
