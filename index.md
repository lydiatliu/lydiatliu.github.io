I am a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Moritz Hardt](http://www.moritzhardt.com/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) <sup>&alpha;</sup>. I am affiliated with [RISELab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/).
I recently obtained my BSE in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University, where I was fortunate to work with [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/), [Han Liu](https://www.princeton.edu/~hanliu/), and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/). Before that, I spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research, Cambridge, with the [Reinforcement Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/reinforcement-learning-group/).

I'm excited about __reliable machine learning__, __high-dimensional statistics__, and __stochastic optimization__. For applications, I am interested in problems in the empirical sciences, and in artificial intelligence. Read about my [research](/projects).
