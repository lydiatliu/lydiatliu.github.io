I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Moritz Hardt](http://mrtz.org/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). My current research examines the **theoretical foundations of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making**, with a focus on **societal impact and human welfare.** Other interests include microeconomics and high-dimensional statistics.

Previously, I graduated with a BSE in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University, where I was fortunate to work with [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/), [Han Liu](https://www.princeton.edu/~hanliu/), and [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/). I have also spent two wonderful summers interning at Microsoft Research: hosted by Urun Dogan and [Katja Hofmann](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kahofman/) in the [Reinforcement Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/reinforcement-learning-group/) at [MSR Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) in 2016, and hosted by [Christian Borgs](http://christianborgs.com/), [Jennifer Chayes](http://jenniferchayes.com/), and [Adam Tauman Kalai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/adum/) at [MSR-NE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) in 2019.

I am supported by a [Microsoft Ada Lovelace Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/ada-lovelace-fellowship/) and an [Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-phil-ai-fellowship-2019-class).
