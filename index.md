‚≠ê **From January 2024, I will be assistant professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu) at Princeton University.**  Students interested in my research group should apply to our [PhD program](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad) this fall!

I am a postdoctoral associate at [Cornell University Computer Science](http://cis.cornell.edu/cornell-computing-information-science), working with [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), [Karen Levy](https://www.karen-levy.net), and [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org) in  the [Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice (AIPP)](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu) initiative. My research examines the **theoretical foundations of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making**, with a focus on **societal impact and welfare**. <!-- Other interests include microeconomics and high-dimensional statistics.--> 

I obtained my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) from University of California, Berkeley in May 2022, advised by [Moritz Hardt](http://mrtz.org/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I received a [Microsoft Ada Lovelace Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/ada-lovelace-fellowship/), an [Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-phil-ai-fellowship-2019-class), an NUS Development Grant, and an ICML Best Paper Award. 

Previously, I completed my B.S.E. in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I have also spent two wonderful summers at Microsoft Research, most recently at [MSR New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) in 2019.



<!--**I am on the faculty job market for 2022-2023!**

<!-- **Updates**. 
> (Nov 2022) I gave a talk at the Simons workshop on Societal Considerations and Applications.
 (Sep 2022) Our cross-disciplinary study of machine learning in education, *Lost in Translation: Reimagining the Machine Learning Life Cycle in Education*, is on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03929).
  (Oct 2021) [I attended MIT EECS Rising Stars 2021](https://risingstars21-eecs.mit.edu/liu-lydia-tingruo/)---[apply](https://risingstars21-eecs.mit.edu) for the fall 2022 workshop at UT Austin! We presented our [poster for _Strategic ranking_](/assets/strategic_ranking_poster.pdf) at the inaugural ACM conference on EAAMO. [_Bandit Learning in Decentralized Matching Markets_](https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-1429.html) is in vol. 22 of JMLR. See [EC workshop poster](/assets/decentralizedbandits_poster.pdf) and [FODSI talk](/assets/learning_markets.pdf).-->
