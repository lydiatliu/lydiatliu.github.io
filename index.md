I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Michael Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) and [Moritz Hardt](http://www.moritzhardt.com/). I am affliated with [RISELab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/).
I recently obtained my BSE in Operations Research and Financial Engineering from Princeton University, where I was fortunate to work with [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/) and [Han Liu](https://www.princeton.edu/~hanliu/). Before that, I also spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research, Cambridge, with the [Reinforcement Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/reinforcement-learning-group/).


My interests are in __high dimensional statistics__ and __stochastic optimization__. For applications,
			I am interested in problems in the empirical sciences, and in artificial intelligence. Read about my
			[research](/projects).
