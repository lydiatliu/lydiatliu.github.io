<img src="img/me4.jpg" alt="Photo" class="leftside_image">

I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Michael Jordan and Moritz Hardt.
			Previously I obtained my BSE in Operations Research and Financial Engineering from Princeton University, 
			where I was fortunate to work with Amit Singer and Han Liu. I have also spent a wonderful summer at Microsoft Research Cambridge, 
			working with Katja Hofmann and Urun Dogan.


My interests are in __high dimensional statistics__ and __stochastic optimization__. For applications,
			I am interested in problems in the empirical sciences, and in artificial intelligence. Read about my
			![research](/projects/).
